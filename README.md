# Todolist Redux Core

Todolist Redux Core is a React-based to-do list application that uses **Redux for state management**, implementing the reducer logic manually according to **Redux Core principles**. This project demonstrates how Redux works under the hood without relying on external state management tools like Redux Toolkit.

## Technologies
- **React** - for building the user interface.
- **Redux (core implementation)** - manually written reducer logic and actions.
- **React-Redux** - for connecting Redux with React components.
- **CSS3** - for styling the application.

## Features
- Add, remove, and toggle tasks as completed.
- Uses Redux for centralized state management.
- Manually written reducer logic and actions (instead of using Redux Toolkit).
- Demonstrates core Redux principles (actions, reducers, store, dispatch).
- Simple and minimalistic UI.
